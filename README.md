# UDP-based server and client communication application

### Description

- Communication is built on message exchanges between the server and the client, with regular expressions and socket programming used for specific activities. This solution enables a server to handle requests to grant authorization to certain clients and to allow clients to do actions. This project offers a fundamental foundation for ensuring communication between server and client. The server has the ability to provide authorization to clients and control requests for certain actions. It also provides flexibility in the manner in which clients interface with the server, manages error circumstances, and delivers appropriate messages. This project is an excellent learning tool for gaining basic network programming abilities and grasping fundamental principles in UDP-based communication.
